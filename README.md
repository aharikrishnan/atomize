#### what's Atom?
  Atom is a open-source text editor based on [chromium](https://www.chromium.org/ "Open-source google chrome browser project") and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/ "JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. "), which is a [better alternative][?] to [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/ "Sublime text editor")

  > Atom is a text editor that's modern, approachable, yet hackable to the coreâ€”a tool you can customize to do anything but also use productively without ever touching a config file. [^]
